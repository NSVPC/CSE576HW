    "Definition": "In this task we ask you to read the given sentence and construct a question about the information present in the sentence. Construct a question in such a way that (i) it is unambiguous, (ii) it is answerable from the sentence using coreference resolution. coreference resolution is the task of clustering mentions in text that refer to the same underlying real world entities. For example let's take a sentence 'I voted for Obama because he was most aligned with my values, she said.' Here in this example 'I', 'my', and 'she' belong to the same cluster and 'Obama' and 'he' belong to the same cluster. Now let's discuss another example , original sentence: 'I voted for Trump because he was most aligned with my values',John said. Now here is the same sentence with resolved coreferences: 'John voted for Trump because Trump was most aligned with John's values',John said. (iii) its answer is unique (iv) its answer is a continuous text span from the sentence. Avoid creating questions that (i) can be answered correctly without actually understanding the sentence and (ii) uses same words or phrases given in the sentence.",
